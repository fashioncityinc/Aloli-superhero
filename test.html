<h2><span style="color:gold;">Mulan is a young chinese woman who decides to enlist in the chinese war in place of her elderly and frail father since her only brother was a little baby.<br>She cuts her hair, totally transforming into a man and goes off to the training camp wher she successfully passes off as a man, makes new friends and improves her fighting skills, with the help of her guardian angel, a small dragon called Mushu.</span></p></h2>
<p>My favourite colour is <span style="color:gold;">blue</span></p>
